## Description

This is a simple webpage which utilises mostly html and CSS, along with a small amount of CSS to allow uses to create and track different projects. I started this project to gain a deeper understanding of 3rd party APIs, specifically Bootstrap, JQuery, Jquery UI, and Day JS. The task board allows users toe sily track multiple tasks and at a glance they can determine if the task is overdue, due today, or due in the future. 


## Installation

No istallation neeeded, this runs in a web browser.

## Usage

To use this webpage click the 'Add Task' button and provide a title, date, and description. As you complete the task you can move it between the 3 columns, 'To Do', 'In Progress', and 'Done'. To remove the task you can click the delete button which is added to each task card. The background color of each task will cahnge automaically, with the default grey representing a due date at least 1 day in the furutre, yellow for projects due today, and red for overdue.
